"""Generate the five QR codes for the trifold, and the standalone PNGs.

Each code carries a Switchy short link, not the destination. Three reasons,
and the first two are the important ones:

  1. A printed code cannot be changed. The short link can, so a destination
     that moves, or a rebuilt site that renames a path, is a redirect edit
     rather than a reprint. This brochure has already had three addresses go
     404 under it once.
  2. Short payloads mean few modules, and few modules mean each module is
     physically large enough to survive press. These fit at error correction
     H with room to spare; the long URLs with UTM tails did not.
  3. The UTM parameters ride on the redirect, so the campaign reporting is
     unchanged and none of it costs modules here.

Each code takes its own panel's colour, on white, at error correction H with
four modules of quiet zone.

The colours are gated, but by a scan test rather than a contrast rule. An
earlier version of this file used a WCAG contrast threshold of 4.5:1, which is
a readability figure for text and turns out to be far too strict for a QR code
at this size: it rejected Education Blue #3780B8 at 4.25:1 and the brand gold
#C9A227 at 2.42:1, and both of those decode reliably at error correction H with
0.649mm modules. A code IS readable or it is not, and that is measurable, so
every colour is now rendered at its printed size, degraded to simulate ink
spread and a phone camera, and decoded. If it does not come back, the build
stops. The deep ends of the gradients survive about twice as much blur, so if a
proof off the press ever disappoints, they are the fallback.
