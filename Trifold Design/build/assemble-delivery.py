Two folders, and they answer two different questions.

    SEND-TO-PRINTER/        what goes to the print shop. Two files, no options.
    exports/brochure-2026/  everything else: proofs, the QR codes, a zip.

Both are copies, rebuilt from scratch each run, so neither can hold a stale file
that quietly disagrees with the artwork. The build outputs themselves live in
Trifold Design/print/, with the formats nobody asked for under alternates/.
